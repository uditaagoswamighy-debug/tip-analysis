## Tip Analysis Project

This project explores tipping behavior using the seaborn `tips` dataset.
The goal is to analyze how average tips vary across different conditions.

### Questions Explored
- Do customers tip more during lunch or dinner?
- Do smokers tip more than non-smokers?

### Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Key Findings
- Average tips are higher during dinner compared to lunch.
- The difference in tipping behavior between smokers and non-smokers is negligible.

This project demonstrates basic exploratory data analysis, grouped aggregation, and clear communication of insights.
